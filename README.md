A Simple, Borderless Payments Made Easy
Welcome to PayMe. We built this app to make sending and receiving money as easy as sending a message. Whether you’re paying a friend across the street or across the world, PayMe makes it fast, secure, and almost free.

No need to keep complicated wallet addresses or annoying seed phrases. Think of it like "WhatsApp" but for payments. Just simple payments that work.

How PayMe Works
Getting started is straightforward. All you need is your email. Once you sign up, PayMe creates a permanent wallet for you automatically. Your wallet is tied to a username.

To send or receive money, all you need is a username. That’s it. No long, confusing wallet addresses. Payments happen instantly.

If someone knows your username, they can pay you. It’s that simple. Fast, secure, and almost free.

Why PayMe Stands Out
PayMe is built on the Solana network. This gives you fast transactions, low fees, and high-performance security.

You never have to worry about banks or business hours. Username-based payments mean everything is easy to remember. The platform is designed to be simple and approachable, even if you’ve never used blockchain before.

Built on Solana
Solana gives PayMe the speed, security, and low fees that make global, almost-free payments possible.
